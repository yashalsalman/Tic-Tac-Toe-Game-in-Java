Skills Used: Core Java, Java Swing

I created this project as part of my Java learning journey to strengthen my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), event-driven programming, and GUI application development. It demonstrates the seamless integration of logic and design using Java Swing components within the Apache NetBeans environment.

This is a fully interactive Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java using the Swing library, built and tested in Apache NetBeans IDE.
It features a clean, intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for two players to enjoy the classic 3×3 grid game on the same system.

Features:
1. 🎮Two-player mode (Player X vs. Player O) on the same system.
2. 🖱️ Mouse-based interaction for marking cells.
3. ⚡ Real-time win detection and draw recognition.
4. 🔄 Reset button to start a new game instantly.
5. 🎨 User-friendly, minimalistic design for smooth gameplay.
6. 🧩 Well-structured code with separation of logic and interface.
